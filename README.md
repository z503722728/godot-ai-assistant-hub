==========================

A Flexible Godot Plugin for AI Assistants
-----------------------------------------

Embed AI assistants in Godot with the ability to read and write code in Godot's Code Editor.

It leverages [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) as an LLM provider, an open-source tool to run models locally for free. If you're not familiar with Ollama, I found it to be extremely simple to use; you should give it a try!

If you use ChatGPT, Gemini, or similar tools with a REST API, you could easily extend this addon to work with them—it was designed to be API agnostic. See the videos for more information on this.

**Key Features**
---------------

#### ✍️ Assistants can write code or documentation directly in Godot's Code Editor.
#### 👀 Assistants can read the code you highlight for quick interactions.
#### 🪄 Save reusable prompts to ask your assistant to act with a single button.
#### 🤖 Create your own assistant types and quick prompts without coding.
#### 💬 Have multiple chat sessions with different types of assistants simultaneously.
#### ⏪ Edit the conversation history in case your assistant gets confused by some of your prompts.
#### 💻 Call LLMs locally or remotely.

**System Requirements**
-----------------------

It depends on the models you use and the speed you expect. Of course, if you extend the plugin to run hosted models (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.), then you don't need to worry about this (just about the bills).

**Tested in Godot 4.3.**

If you test it in other versions, let me know in the discussions section so I can add it here.


**Getting Started**
--------------------
This section assumes you have installed [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and installed at least one model. If you are not sure about the models to download, read section "Not sure what models to use?".

### ▶️ If you are feeling like not reading much
Just install it and follow the hints it gives you in Godot itself.

### ▶️ If you want to understand it better
There are 2 main concepts for this addon, familiarize yourself with them, both are Godot [Resources](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/resources.html):

#### A) AI assistant type (AIAssistantResource). 🤖
This is the setup for an assistant, it describes what the assistant does, what LLM model to use, and what Quick Prompts it can use.

Think of it as a template for creating assistants. For example, you can have an assistant that helps with coding, and one that helps with writing. In that case, you would have 2 assistant types, and you can summon as many coders or writers you need.

#### B) Quick Prompt (AIQuickPromptResource). 🪄
Allows to send a prompt in the chat by clicking a button instead of writing it every time. It adds the ability to insert the assistant's answer in the Godot's Code Editor.
The following keywords are used to allow the prompt to pull data from the Code Editor or from the chat prompt.
* Use `{CODE}` to insert the code currently selected in the editor.
* Use `{CHAT}` to include the current content of the text prompt.

## Setup steps
In general this is what you need to do:
1. Download this addon and copy the folder ai_assistant_hub into your addons folder (`res://addons/ai_assistant_hub/`).
2. Enable the plugin in your project settings, you should see a new tab `AI Hub` in the bottom panel.
3. In folder `res://addons/ai_assistant_hub/assistants/` right click, Create New > Resource... > AIAssistantResource
4. Fill up the data for your assistant.
5. Add quick prompts to the assistant if needed.
6. Click the reload button in the plugin to see your new assistant type.
7. Click the assistant type button to start a chat with a new assistant of this type.
8. Start using them to chat, pair programming, write, add inline documentation - it's up to you!

Experiment and build the right type of assistants for your workflow.

### Not sure what models to use?

Some popular models that work fine in low-end computers at the time I wrote this are:
* **llama3.2:** Fast and efficient, but may have occasional accuracy issues.
* **granite-code:** Ideal for coding on lower-end machines.
* **mistral:** Excellent for writing tasks.
* **deepseek-coder-v2:** Powerful coding model (requires at least 8GB of VRAM).

⚠️ If you don't agree with these suggestions, leave a comment in the Discussions page with your suggestions.

If you have a powerful PC, just keep increasing the level of the model. You will see many models have versions like 1.5B, 3B, 7B, 30B, 77B, these mean billions of parameters. You can consider 1.5B for very low-end machines, and 77B for very powerful ones. If you are not sure, just try them out, they are easy to delete as well.

**Who is developing this**
----------
Hi, I'm Forest, I created this addon for my personal use and decided to share it, hope you find it useful.

I'm a solo game developer that sometimes ends up building game dev tools. This a hobby project I may keep improving from time to time. Right now I'm planning to improve it on a need-basis, so there is no formal roadmap. However I welcome ideas in the Discussions section.
